==About ProjectKick

ProjectKick was born out of the desire to understand, visualize and connect with the creative culture of NYC. Kickstarter immediately came to mind as the perfect gateway, but we didn't want to stop at just one city.

We collected thousands of current or successful project data points, across hundreds of US cities going as far back as August 2009. We parsed the data to display in three main ways- by city, category, and funding. Our goal is to help understand the creative culture across the country and see which categories the most popular projects fall under and are the most funded.

ProjectKick is currently visualizing 16716 projects, 463 cities, and 50 categories.
